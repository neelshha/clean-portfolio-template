            I'm a Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity, blending a passion for tech, design, and building real-world solutions. From developing a vulnerability assessment bot with UiPath and OpenAI, to managing the Cybersecurity Club's website and creating my portfolio at neelshha.com, I love projects that merge innovation with impact. I've led digital strategy as Joint General Secretary of my college's MUN Society and as CIO of Mumbai MUN. Skilled in React, Tailwind CSS, Python, and SQL, I'm driven by curiosity, creativity, and the challenge of turning ideas into meaningful digital experiences. Based in Mumbai, I believe thoughtful technology can change the world â€” one project at a time.
