## Customization

This template is designed to be easily customized. Here's how to make it your own:

1.  **Update Content**:
    *   **About Section**: Open `src/components/About.tsx` and edit the text to write your own bio.
    *   **Projects/Work**: Modify `src/components/Work.tsx` to display your projects. Consider creating a separate data file (e.g., `src/data/projects.ts`) and mapping over it to generate project cards dynamically.
    *   **Metadata**: Change the title and meta tags in `index.html`.

2.  **Update Styling**:
    *   **Theme**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` to change colors, fonts, and other design tokens to match your personal brand.
    *   **Global Styles**: For base styles, edit `src/styles/index.css` (or wherever your main CSS import is).

3.  **Replace Assets**:
    *   **Favicon**: Replace the favicon files in the `public/` directory.
    *   **Images & SVGs**: Add your own project screenshots or personal photos to the `src/assets/` directory and update the paths in the components.
